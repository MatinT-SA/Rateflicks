# Rateflix

A fully responsive movie rating app built with React that allows users to search for movies, view ratings, and leave their own reviews. 
I've incorporated dynamic features like search filters, real-time data fetching, and interactive elements with react-spinners for loading animations and react-toastify for notifications.

- react-spinners for loading indicators
